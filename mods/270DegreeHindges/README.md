# 270 Degree Removalble Hinges
This is a modification of Logan Fraser's great design for [270 Degree Removable Hindges]
(https://github.com/LoganFraser/VoronMods/tree/main/ParametricRemovable270Hinges).

The original design calls for using M3x30 or M3x35 SHCS for the hinge pin that slides into
a section of PTFE tubing. Since metric bolts are not as easy to find in the US as other
places, I didn't want to use whatever little hardware I had for that. On the other hand,
steal rods are very easy to find.

So, I modified the design to use a 3mm steal rod instead of M3 SHCS.

## BOM

Most of the items in the original BOM are still required with the exception of the
M3x30/M3x35 SHCS and the 3mm ID, 4mm OD PTFE tubing. The items listed below are per
hinge:

* 1 x 3mmx32mm steal rod. I used this [3mm x 150mm 304 steal rod](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-150mm-Stainless-Steel-Solid/dp/B082ZP4H3N?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1) and cut it into 32mm sections. 
* 1 x 3mm or 1/8" drill bit for drilling the panels.
* 1 x m3-8mm socket head cap screw for hinge frame
* 1 x m3 roll-in nut for hinge frame
* 2 x m3 5x4x3mm heat set insert (voron standard)
* 2 x M3-10mm or 12mm (depending on panel thickness). Can use flat head if you have them or flip the back plates over and use pan or socket heads.

## Assembly

The assembly is pretty streight forward:

1. Insert the 32mm section of steal rod into the upper part of the door hinge. This should be a pretty tight friction fit. You may have to use a hammer or mallet to gently tap it in place. ![image](Images/Upper.JPG)
2. Insert the upper part into the matching lower part. ![image](Images/Lower.JPG)
3. The instructions for the rest of the assembly follows the ones on the original page.
